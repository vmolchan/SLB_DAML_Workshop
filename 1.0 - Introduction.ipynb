    "# Schlumberger Workshop on Data Analytics and Machine learning workshop in Upstream O&G Industry\n",
    "**Instructors:** Lalitha Venkataramanan, Vikas Jain\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The adoption and interest of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms applied to Oil & Gas problems has increased dramatically over the past decade. ML is a subdivision or Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is the process by which computers can learn and make predictions from data without being explicily programmed to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will focus on the applications of AI & ML to petrophysical data over four 2-hour sessions. The workshop will provide an introduction to ML, Data Quality considerations with well log data and how to identify missing data and outliers. It will also cover sample workflows for applying supervised to predict key reservoir properties (Porosity, Water Saturation and Shale Volume) and unsupervised algorithms to identify facies without the need of labelled data.\n",

    "### Repository Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1.0 - General Introduction to the dataset and terminology  \n",
    "1.1 - Initial Data Exploration of the Volve field dataset  \n",
    "1.2 - Identifying missing data  \n",
    "1.3 - Detection of outliers / anomolous data points using manual and automated methods  \n",
    "2.0 - Prediction of key reservoir properties using an Artificial Neural Network from the Keras library  \n",
    "3.0 - Unsupervised Learning example  \n",
    "4.0 - A compiled list of references related to machine learning with petrophysical data  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In 2018, Equinor released the entire contents of the Volve Field to the public domain to foster research and learning. \n",
    "Data includes:\n",
    "- Well Logs \n",
    "- Petrophysical interpretaions\n",
    "- Reports\n",
    "- Core measurements\n",
    "- Seismic data\n",
    "- Models\n",
    "- And more\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is licensed under the Equinor Open Data Licence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Volve Field is located some 200 km west of Stavanger in the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea. Hydrocarbons were discovered within the Jurassic aged Hugin Formation in 1993. Oil production began in 2008 and lasted for 8 years (twice as long as planned) until 2016, when production ceased. In total 63 MMBO were produced over the field's lifetime and reached a plateau of 56,000 B/D.\n",
